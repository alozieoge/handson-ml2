    "## Steps to Machine Learning\n",
    "### A. Frame the problem and look at the big picture\n",
    "1. Define the <u>objective</u> in business terms. \n",
    "2. How will your solution be used?\n",
    "3. What are the current solutions / workarounds (if any)?\n",
    "4. How should you frame this problem (supervised / unsupervised, online / offline|batch, instance-based / model-based, etc)?\n",
    "5. How should <u>performance</u> be measured?\n",
    "6. Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?\n",
    "7. What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?\n",
    "8. What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?\n",
    "9. Is human expertise available (SME)?\n",
    "10. How would you solve the problem manually?\n",
    "11. List the <u>assumptions</u> you (or others) have made so far.\n",
    "12. Verify the assumptions if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Get the data\n",
    "**Note**: Automate as much as possible so you can easily get fresh data. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. List the data you need and how much you need. \n",
    "2. Find and document where you can get the data. \n",
    "3. Check how much <u>space / storage</u> it will take. \n",
    "4. Check legal obigations and get authorization if necessary. \n",
    "5. Get access <u>authorizations</u>. \n",
    "6. Create a workspace (with enough storage space). \n",
    "7. Get the data. \n",
    "8. Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate (without changing the data itself). \n",
    "9. Ensure sensitive information is deleted or protected (e.g. anonymized). \n",
    "10. Check the size and type of data (time series, sample, geographical, etc.).\n",
    "11. Sample a test set, put it aside, and never look at it (no data snooping!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Explore the data\n",
    "**Note**: Try to get insights from a field expert for these steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a copy of the data for exploration (sampling it down to a manageable size if necessary). \n",
    "2. Create a Jupyter notebook to keep a record of your data exploration. \n",
    "3. Study each attribute and its characteristics. \n",
    "    - Name\n",
    "    - Type (categorical, int/float, bounded/unbounded, text, structured, etc.)\n",
    "    - % of missing values\n",
    "    - Noisiness and type of noise (stochastic, outliers, rounding errors, etc.)\n",
    "    - Usefulness for the task\n",
    "    - Type of ditribution (Gaussian, uniform, logarithmic, etc.)\n",
    "4. For supervised learning tasks, identify the target attribute(s). \n",
    "5. <u>Visualize</u> the data. \n",
    "6. Study the correlations between attributes. \n",
    "7. Study how you would solve the problem manually. \n",
    "8. Identify the promising transformations you may want to apply. \n",
    "9. Identify extra data that would be useful (go back to previous step). \n",
    "10. Document what you have learned. \n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Prepare the data\n",
    "**Notes**: \n",
    "- Work on copies of the data (keep original dataset intact). \n",
    "- Write functions for all data <u>transformations</u> you apply, for 5 reasons:\n",
    "    - So you can easily prepare the data the next time you get a fresh dataset\n",
    "    - So you can apply these transformations in future projects\n",
    "    - To clean and prepare the test set\n",
    "    - To clean and prepare new data instannces once your solution is live\n",
    "    - To make it easy to treat your preparation choices as <u>hyper-parameters</u>\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Data cleaning:\n",
    "    - Fix or remove outliers (optional). \n",
    "    - Fill in missing values e.g. with zero, mean, median, ...) or drop their rows (or columns). \n",
    "2. Feature selection (optional):\n",
    "    - Drop the attributes that provide no useful informatin for the task. \n",
    "3. Feature engineering, where appropriate:\n",
    "    - Discretize continuous features. \n",
    "    - Decompose features (e.g. catehorical, date/time, etc.)\n",
    "    - Add promising transformations of features (e.g. `log(x)`, `sqrt(x)`, `x**2`, etc.)\n",
    "    - Aggregate features into promising new features. \n",
    "4. Feature scaling\n",
    "    - Standardize or normalize features. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### E. Shortlist promising models\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "- If the data is huge, sample smaller training sets so you can train many differnt models in a reasonable time (beware that this penlizes complex models such as large neural nets or Random Forests). \n",
    "- Once again, try to automate these steps as much as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train many <u>quick-and-dirty models</u> from different categories (e.g. linear, naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, neural net, etc.) using standard parameters. \n",
    "2. Measure and compare their performance. \n",
    "    - For each model, use k-fold cross-validation and compute the mean and standard deviation of the performance measure on the k-folds. \n",
    "3. Analyze the most significant variables for each algorithm. \n",
    "4. Analyze the types of errors the model make.\n",
    "    - What data would a human have used to avoid these <u>errors</u>?\n",
    "5. Perform a quick round of feature selectin and engineering. \n",
    "6. Perform one or two more quick iterations of the 5 previous steps. \n",
    "7. Shortlist the top 3 to 5 most promising models, preferring models that make the different types of errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "### F. Fine-tune the system\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "- Use as much data as possible for this step, espcially towards the end of fine-tuning. \n",
    "- Always automate what you can\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fine-tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation. \n",
    "    - Treat data transformation choices as hyperparameters, especially when you're unsure about which to go with e.g. replacing missing values with zeros, median, mean or dropping the rows. \n",
    "    - Prefer random search over grid search, unless there are very few parameters to explore. \n",
    "    - If training is very long, prefer a Bayesian optimization approach e.g. using Gaussian process priors. \n",
    "2. Try Ensemble methods. Combine the best models to produce better performance than runnning them individually. \n",
    "3. Measure the performance of the final model on the test set to estimate generalization error.\n",
    "    - Don't tweak your model after measuring generaization error - will only lead to over-fitting on the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### G. Present your solution\n",
    "1. Document your work and approach. \n",
    "2. Create a nice presentation. \n",
    "    - Highlight the big picture first. \n",
    "3. Explain **why** your solution achieves the business objective. \n",
    "4. Present interesting points you noticed along the way. \n",
    "    - Describe what worked and what did not. \n",
    "    - List assumptions and limitations of your system.\n",
    "5. Use beautiful visualizatins or easy-to-remember statements to communicate your key findings (e.g. \"the median income is the number-one predictor of house prices\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "### H. Launch!\n",
    "1. Get your solution ready for production (plug into production data inputs, write unit tests, etc.)\n",
    "2. Write monitoring code to check your system's live performance at regular intervals and trigger alerts when it drops. \n",
    "    - Beware of slow degradation: models tend to rot as data evolves. \n",
    "    - Measuring performace may require a human pipeline (e.g. via a crowdsourcing service). \n",
    "    - Also monitor your inputs' quality (e.g. a malfunctioning sensor sending random values, a team's output becoming stale). Important for online learning systems. \n",
    "3. (Automatically) retrain your models on a regular basis on fresh data.    "

    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Select a performance measure ✅\n",
    "    - RMSE: Gives a measure of the error, with higher weight for larger errors - $L_2$ norm. \n",
    "    Preferred for when outliers are exponentially rare.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $RMSE(X,h) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m} (h(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2}$\n",

    "    \n",
    "    $MAE(X,h) = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m} |h(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)}|$\n",

    "    - In general, the $L_k$ norm of a vector $v$ is:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $||v_k|| = (|v_0|^k + |v_1|^k + |v_2|^k + ... + |v_n|^k)^{1/k}$\n",

    "    The higher the norm index, the more it focuses on large values and neglects small ones. \n",
